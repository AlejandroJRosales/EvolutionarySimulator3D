# EvolutionarySimulator3D
A continuation of Sebastian Lague's "Coding Adventure: Simulating an Ecosystem". I am taking his original design, and expanding on it by adding in new features. I would like to thank him for creating such a magnificant simulation.

# How to run
To begin, this is a unity project. I use Visual Studios 2019 to edit the C# files. You need to clone this repositroy. Personally, I perfer to use TortiseGit. You can copy the https or ssh and clone to the repository to an empty folder with two clicks. Then, if you ever wanted to add updates, you can comit changes with a two clicks as well.
